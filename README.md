# Gender-Ambiguous Voices Database
This repository compiles and maintains a database of open-source, gender-ambiguous voices to support researchers in Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, etc.

## But, what is a Gender-Ambiguous Voice?
A gender-ambiguous voice combines masculine and feminine traits, making it difficult to categorize clearly as either "male" or "female". These voices reflect the complexity and fluidity of gender expression, challenging traditional, binary views of gender in speech.

## üìå Why This Matters
Although synthetic voices are increasingly used in research and technology, there is a shortage of openly available gender-ambiguous voices. This database serves as a valuable resource for researchers to find and compare these voices. 
Collecting gender-ambiguous voices is essential for creating more inclusive and accurate technologies, such as speech recognition and synthesis systems. By incorporating these voices, we can better represent a wider range of gender identities, improving inclusivity, enhancing technology accuracy, and promoting a more respectful and diverse representation of individuals.

## ‚úÖ Available Ambiguous Voices

### üìö Ambiguous Voices from Research Studies
These voices were developed as part of academic research:

1) I. Lopatovska et al. (2022) - Contextual Perceptions of Feminine-, Masculine- and Gender-Ambiguous-Sounding Conversational Agents: [Matthew and Leslie Voices](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12CAgUXcNb18HASe1FJLKXDNe0RGxBSu2)
2) J. M. Kuch et al. (2023) - Effects of gender neutralization on the anthropomorphism of natural and synthetic voices: [Experiment Audio Files](https://gitlab.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/hri-group/kuch-audio-files)
3) A. Danielescu et al. (2023) - Creating Inclusive Voices for the 21st Century: A Non-Binary Text-to-Speech for Conversational Assistants: [Sam, the Non-Binary TTS Voice](https://github.com/Sam-Accenture-Non-Binary-Voice/non-binary-voice-files)


### üåê Ambiguous Voices from Open-Source Platforms

These voices are available through public platforms and allow researchers to generate their own sentences. However, some platforms may have limitations, such as requiring payment after a certain number of characters.
