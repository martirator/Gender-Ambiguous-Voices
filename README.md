# 🌐 Open-Source Gender-Ambiguous Voices Database
This repository compiles and maintains a database of open-source, gender-ambiguous voices to support researchers in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), linguistics, AI ethics, and accessibility.

## 📌 Why This Matters
Despite the growing use of synthetic voices in research and technology, there is a lack of openly available gender-ambiguous voices. This database serves as:
- A resource for researchers to find and compare available voices
- A tool to analyze voice characteristics and ambiguity
- A catalyst for fostering development and sharing of new voices

## 🏛️ Ambiguous Voices from Research Studies

These voices were developed as part of academic research and are publicly available for listening. While they allow users to hear how they sound, they are not interactive, meaning researchers cannot generate their own sentences using these voices.

1) J. M. Kuch et al. (2023) - Studied the effects of gender neutralization on the anthropomorphism of natural and synthetic voices
2) A. Danielescu et al. (2023) - Developed a non-binary TTS voice for conversational assistants
3) I. Lopatovska et al. (2022)

Examined perceptions of feminine, masculine, and gender-ambiguous voices in conversational agents

## 🌍 Ambiguous Voices from Open-Source Platforms

These voices are available through public platforms and allow researchers to generate their own sentences. However, some platforms may have limitations, such as requiring payment after a certain number of characters.
